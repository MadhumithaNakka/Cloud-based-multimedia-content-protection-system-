We propose a new design for large-scale multimedia content protection systems. Our design leverages cloud
 infrastructures to provide cost efficiency, rapid deployment, scalability, and elasticity to accommodate varying workloads. The proposed system can be used to protect different multimedia content types, including videos, images, audio clips, songs and music clips. The system can be deployed on private and/or public clouds. Our system has two novel components: method to create signatures of videos and distributed matching engine for multimedia objects. The signature method creates robust and representative signatures of videos that capture the depth signals in these videos and it is computationally efficient to compute and compare as well as it requires small storage. The distributed matching engine achieves high scalability and it is designed to support different multimedia objects. 

The focus of this project is on the other approach for protecting multimedia content, which is content based copy detection (CBCD). In this approach, signatures (or fingerprints) are extracted from original objects. Signatures are also created from query (suspected) objects downloaded from online sites. Then, the similarity is computed between original and suspected objects to find potential copies. 
Many previous works proposed different methods for creating and matching signatures. These methods can be classified into four categories: spatial, temporal, color and transform-domain. Spatial signatures (particularly the block-based) are the most widely used. 
we design our system such that previous content-based copy detection methods for creating and matching signatures can be implemented within our system. In addition to our cloud-based system, we propose a new method for 3D video fingerprinting, and a new design for the distributed matching engine. The works related to each of these components are summarized in the following subsections.
